  <p class="subtitle">Enter Orlando and Adam.</p>

  <p>As I remember, Adam, it was  <span  class="tooltip" title="i.e., after this fashion that my father (The play opens in the middle of a conversation between Orlando and Adam.)">upon this fashion</span> bequeathed me by will <span  class="tooltip" title="i.e., only one">but poor a </span> thousand <span  class="tooltip" title="coins (worth around five shillings each)">crowns</span>, and, as thou sayst, <span  class="tooltip" title="i.e., required of my brother as a condition for receiving our father's blessing that my brother educate or bring me up properly my brother: i.e., Oliver">charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well</span>. And there begins my sadness. My brother <span  class="tooltip" title=" i.e., Jacques, but pronounced 'jakes,' or where the meter requires, 'jay-kwees'">Jaques</span> he keeps at <span  class="tooltip" title=" probably, university">school</span>, and report speaks goldenly of his <span  class="tooltip" title="proficiency">profit</span>. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, <span  class="tooltip" title="detains">stays</span> me here at home unkept; for call you that "keeping" for a <span  class="tooltip" title="i.e., the son of a knight">gentleman of my birth</span>, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are <span  class="tooltip" title="brought up, trained">bred</span> better, for, besides that they are <span  class="tooltip" title="i.e. beautiful to look at because their feed is good and plentiful">fair with their feeding</span>, they are <span  class="tooltip" title=" i.e., trained to obey (hand and voice) commands">taught their manage</span> and, to that end, <span  class="tooltip" title=" horse-trainers;">riders</span> dearly hired. But I, his brother, gain nothing <span  class="tooltip" title=": i.e., under his control or authority">under him</span> but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much <span  class="tooltip" title="obligated">bound</span> to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his <span  class="tooltip" title="regard, patronage (used ironically to mean 'lack of regard')">countenance</span> seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his <span  class="tooltip" title="servants">hinds</span>, bars me the place of a brother, and, <span  class="tooltip" title="i.e., to the extent that he can">as much as in him lies</span>, <span  class="tooltip" title="undermines">mines</span> my <span  class="tooltip" title=" status as a gentleman by birth">gentility</span> with my <span  class="tooltip" title="i.e., lack of education">education</span>.
