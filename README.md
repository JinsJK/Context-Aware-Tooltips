# Context-Aware-Tooltips
Developed an innovative web application feature that enhances user interaction and experience through context-aware tooltips. These tooltips dynamically adjust content and presentation based on user behavior and environmental factors, offering personalized and intuitive interface guidance. The project included the design and implementation of a prototype within a text-rich interface, providing on-demand explanations for complex terms to aid comprehension and interaction. Utilized HTML and CSS for seamless web integration, demonstrating the potential to significantly improve user engagement with digital interfaces. Conducted user studies to validate the effectiveness of the tooltips in improving readability and comprehension, with a significant majority preferring this intuitive system over traditional methods.
